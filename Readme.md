This is a Unity3D project for an android app created for a event "Photo in a Photo" for "Techtonic 2k17" at Sinhgad Institutes, Vadgaon. It was used on 12/Feb/2017 by more than 150 students.

It features basic login page, level login page, a jigsaw game, and a basic "four-pic" game. It works on almost all potrait resolutions.

The apk "GithubBuild" as well as the project has been stripped of most photos to reduce its size. Other two apk still feature missing pictures.

Installation and first run take good amount of time so be patient. Each build is provided with passwords.txt (which also gets generated at persistant data path for convenience).

<Login ID>        Team Number: <Password>
The team password is login page password. Subsequent passwords are for levels. Please refrain from using login ID 0 as it was for testing.
